/* this file is mandatory so we can run 3 ways:
 * GRAHPICS set to 1 - supresses ALL text output, draws instead.
 * GRAPHICS set to 0 - text mode, VERBOSE controls what prints.
 * TEXT has 2 modes: 
 * VERBOSE to 1 to get DEBUG output 
 * VERBOSE to 0 to get only the required text output
 * Do not set TEXT or DEBUG directly; change GRAHPICS and VERBOSE instead.
